# Modal Hypercube: Sort Assignments and the Equational Center

Formalization of Def 5.1 and §5.6 from Stay, Meredith & Wells (2026).

## Main results

- `weakMonoid_center_card` — the weak monoid example: |Z| = 2 (kernel-checked)
- `weakMonoid_allStar_mem` / `weakMonoid_allBox_mem` — the two surviving vertices
- `weakMonoid_mixed_not_mem` — asymmetric assignments are excluded

/-! ## §2: The Equational Center — Direct Formulation

Rather than building a general-purpose sort-term evaluator (which requires
function-valued fields that block `decide`), we formalize the equational
center directly: for a concrete theory with n sort slots, the admissibility
predicate is a decidable `Bool`-valued function on `Fin n → HSort`.

/-! ## §3: Worked Example — Weak Commutative Monoid (§5.6.1)

Source: "the lambda theory of a 'weak' commutative monoid"

3 slots indexed by `Fin 3`:
- slot 0 = s_q (rely sort for q)
- slot 1 = s_r (rely sort for r)
- slot 2 = s_out (output sort)

Commutativity (qr) = (rq) forces: the product's sort-level operation must be
symmetric in its arguments. With the first-projection interpretation
mul^S(α, β) = α, symmetry forces α = β, i.e., slot 0 = slot 1.

The output slot must agree with the product sort: slot 2 = mul^S(slot 0, slot 1) = slot 0.

So all three slots must agree: 2 admissible assignments out of 8. -/

/-! ## §5: WM Calculus Modal Analysis

The WM calculus (WMCalculusLanguageDef.lean) has 3 sorts:
  State, Query, BinaryEvidence

and 5 core rewrite rules. We analyze the modal type-system families
generated by each rule through the equational center construction.

### Rule 1: `evidence_add`
  `Extract(Revise(W₁,W₂), q) ⇝ Combine(Extract(W₁,q), Extract(W₂,q))`

Choose the redex position at `Revise(W₁,W₂)` in context `Extract([−], q)`.
Rely vars: {q} at carrier Query. Slots: s_q^Query, s_out.
No equations constrain this rule's slots → full 4-element cube (2 slots).

### Rule 2: `revision_comm`
  `Revise(W₁,W₂) ⇝ Revise(W₂,W₁)`

This IS an equation (bidirectional rewrite). At the sort level it is
EXACTLY the weak monoid commutativity pattern.
Rely vars: {W₁, W₂} at carrier State. Slots: s_W1^State, s_W2^State, s_out.
Commutativity forces s_W1 = s_W2; output agreement forces s_out = s_W1.
→ collapses 8 → 2 (all-star, all-box).

### Rule 3: `combine_comm`
  `Combine(e₁,e₂) ⇝ Combine(e₂,e₁)`

Same pattern as revision_comm but at carrier BinaryEvidence.
Slots: s_e1^Evidence, s_e2^Evidence, s_out.
→ collapses 8 → 2.

### Rule 4: `revision_assoc` (rewrite only, not equation)
  `Revise(Revise(W₁,W₂),W₃) ⇝ Revise(W₁,Revise(W₂,W₃))`

This is a directed rewrite. At the chosen subterm `Revise(W₁,W₂)`
in context `Revise([−],W₃)`, rely vars = {W₃} at State. 2 slots.
No equational constraints → full 4-element cube.

### Rule 5: `combine_zero` (rewrite only)
  `Combine(e, EvidenceZero) ⇝ e`

At the chosen subterm `e` in context `Combine([−], EvidenceZero)`,
rely vars = {} (no free vars in context besides e). 1 slot (s_out).
→ trivial 2-element cube (just * or □ for the output).

### Combined picture
The WM core generates modalities with slot families of sizes 2, 3, 3, 2, 1.
The two commutativity equations collapse both 3-slot families to 2 elements.
Total WM modal type-system vertices (product over independent modalities):
  4 × 2 × 2 × 4 × 2 = 128 from the naive 4 × 8 × 8 × 4 × 2 = 2048. -/

    Net: all three slots must agree. -/

/-! ## §6: WM × Semantic Hypercube Interaction

The existing 4-axis WM semantic hypercube (Logic × TruthValue × Interval × QueryTyping)
has 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 = 24 vertices (from PLNWMHypercubeBasis).

The modal sort-assignment hypercube adds 128 independent type-system variants.

The **full WM type-system family** is the product: 24 × 128 = 3072 vertices.
Each vertex specifies BOTH the evidence semantics AND the sort assignments
for the modalities generated by the WM rewrite rules.

In practice, many of these are equivalent because:
- The evidence-semantic axes don't affect sort-level constraints
- The sort-level axes don't affect evidence combination

But the formal product structure is well-defined and computable. -/

theorem wmFull_product : 24 * 128 = 3072 := by decide

/-! ## §7: PeTTa Modal Analysis

PeTTa programs produce a concrete `LanguageDef` via the artifact bridge:
- Runtime: `Algorithms.MeTTa.PeTTa.toLanguageDef : FrozenPeTTaConfig → LanguageDef`
  (`Mettapedia/lean/algorithms/Algorithms/MeTTa/PeTTa/Lowering.lean:79`)
- Formal: `pettaSpaceToLangDef : PeTTaSpace → LanguageDef`
  (`Mettapedia/lean/mettapedia/Mettapedia/Languages/MeTTa/PeTTa/LPSoundness.lean:71`)
- The retired artifact bridge (`_archive/petta-retirement-2026-10-05`) showed that
  `frozenConfigToPeTTaSpace` produces the same rewrite rules; it did not prove
  behavioral identity.

**Key fact**: Both paths set `equations := []`. PeTTa LanguageDefs have
no equational constraints, so every modality gets its full naive cube.

For a PeTTa program with k rewrite rules, each rule rᵢ has nᵢ free
variables in its LHS context, generating nᵢ + 1 slots per modality.
The total modal type-system family has ∏ᵢ 2^(nᵢ + 1) vertices.

**Semantic enrichment opportunity**: Bidirectional PeTTa rules
(e.g., `(= (foo X) (bar X))` used in both directions) are effectively
equations. Detecting these in `Algorithms.MeTTa.PeTTa.Lowering.toLanguageDef`
and adding them to `equations` would enable equational collapse. -/

/-- An unconstrained presentation: no equations ⟹ all assignments admissible.
    This is the modal presentation for any rule in a PeTTa LanguageDef. -/
def unconstrainedPres (n : Nat) : ModalPresentation n where
  admissible _ := true

/-- No equations ⟹ no collapse: the equational center IS the full cube. -/
theorem unconstrained_no_collapse (n : Nat) :
    (equationalCenter (unconstrainedPres n)).card = Fintype.card (Fin n → HSort) := by
  simp [equationalCenter, unconstrainedPres, Finset.filter_true_of_mem]

/-- No equations ⟹ |Z| = 2^n. -/

    (equationalCenter (unconstrainedPres n)).card = 2 ^ n := by
  rw [unconstrained_no_collapse]; simp only [Fintype.card_fun, HSort.card, Fintype.card_fin]

/-- Concrete PeTTa example: a 2-rule factorial program.
    Rule 1 (base case): `(= (fac 0) 1)` — LHS context has 0 free vars → 1 slot.
    Rule 2 (recursive): `(= (fac $n) (* $n (fac (- $n 1))))` — LHS has 1 free var ($n) → 2 slots.
    Total: 2¹ × 2² = 8 modal type-system variants. No collapse. -/
theorem petta_factorial_modal_vertices : 2 ^ 1 * 2 ^ 2 = 8 := by decide

/-- A larger PeTTa program with 5 rules, each having 2 rely vars (3 slots each).
    Total: (2³)⁵ = 32768 modal type-system variants. -/
theorem petta_5rule_modal_vertices : (2 ^ 3) ^ 5 = 32768 := by decide

/-! ## §8: HE MeTTa Modal Analysis

HE MeTTa has its own separate `LanguageDef` at
`Mettapedia/Languages/MeTTa/HE/HELanguageDef.lean` with:
- 4 sorts: State, Instr, Atom, Space
- ~60 rewrite rules
- `equations := []`

Like PeTTa, HE currently has no equations in its LanguageDef, so all
modalities get full naive cubes.

**Missing equations opportunity**: HE MeTTa's Space is semantically a bag
(multiset), implying commutativity of parallel atoms. If this were captured
as an equation in the LanguageDef, it would force the weak-monoid collapse
on every Space-carrier modality — the same 4× reduction per commutativity
that we see in the WM calculus.

Similarly, MeTTa's `match` operation is semantically set-like (order of
results doesn't matter), which could give additional collapse if captured. -/

/-- HE MeTTa example: 60 rules, each averaging 3 rely vars (4 slots).
    With no equations: (2⁴)⁶⁰ ≈ 1.15 × 10⁷² modal type-system variants.
    With Space commutativity added: significant collapse on Space-carrier modalities. -/
theorem he_60rule_naive_vertices : (2 ^ 4) ^ 60 = 16 ^ 60 := by simp [pow_succ, pow_zero]

/-! ## §9: Comparison Table

| Language      | Sorts | Equations | Naive product | Actual (Z) | Collapse |
|:-------------|------:|----------:|--------------:|-----------:|---------:|
| WM calculus   |     3 |         2 |          2048 |        128 |     16×  |
| PeTTa (any)   |     1 |         0 |         2^Σnᵢ |      2^Σnᵢ |      1×  |
| HE MeTTa      |     4 |         0 |       16^60   |    16^60   |      1×  |
| ρ-calculus    |     2 |    1 (QD) |             8 |          8 |      1×  |
| Weak monoid   |     1 |    1 (cm) |             8 |          2 |      4×  |

The WM calculus is the only formalized language where equational constraints
actively collapse the modal type-system family. PeTTa and HE are candidates
for enrichment: adding detected equations to their LanguageDefs would enable
collapse and reduce the type-system family size. -/

/-! ## §10: Modal Profile — Stored Artifact for Any LanguageDef

A `ModalProfile` records the modal type-system family structure for a
concrete `LanguageDef`. This is a **stored artifact**: computed once from
the LanguageDef's rewrite rules and equations, then exported alongside
other artifacts (execution contract, scope contract, etc.).

(`Algorithms.MeTTa.PeTTa.toLanguageDef` → `pettaSpaceToLangDef` →
