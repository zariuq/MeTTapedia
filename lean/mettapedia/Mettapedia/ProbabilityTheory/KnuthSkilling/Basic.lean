/-! ## Cox's Theorem Style Consistency Axioms

Following Cox's theorem, we need:
1. **Functional equation for disjunction**: There exists S : ℝ × ℝ → ℝ such that
   v(a ⊔ b) = S(v(a), v(b)) when Disjoint a b
2. **Functional equation for negation**: There exists N : ℝ → ℝ such that
   v(aᶜ) = N(v(a))
3. These functions must satisfy certain consistency requirements

From these, we can DERIVE that S(x,y) = x + y and N(x) = 1 - x.

/-! ### Regraduation: What we DERIVE vs what we ASSUME

**Logical Flow** (following K&S):

1. **AssociativityTheorem** (Appendix A): Order + Associativity → ∃ Linearizer φ
   - On a discrete grid (iterate n a), φ linearizes the operation: φ(x ⊕ y) = φ(x) + φ(y)
   - This is proven constructively without continuity assumptions

2. **Archimedean Property**: The discrete grid is dense in [0,1]
   - This extends the linearizer from the grid to all rationals
   - Then monotonicity + density extends to all reals

3. **Calibration**: Choose φ(0) = 0, φ(1) = 1
   - Combined with additivity, this forces φ = id on [0,1]!

**What we ASSUME**: `combine_eq_add` (the linearizer exists)
**What we DERIVE**: `additive` (from Archimedean + combine_eq_add)

The separation below makes this logical dependency explicit.

/-- The Archimedean property: the discrete grid is dense.
For any ε > 0, there exists n such that 1/n < ε.
This is what allows extending from discrete linearizers to continuous ones. -/
class ArchimedeanDensity where
  /-- For any positive ε, we can find a grid point smaller than ε -/
  density : ∀ ε : ℝ, 0 < ε → ∃ n : ℕ, 0 < n ∧ (1 : ℝ) / n < ε

/-! ## Knuth-Skilling Algebra: The Minimal Axioms

**THE FUNDAMENTAL ABSTRACTION** (following K&S Appendix A):

A Knuth-Skilling Algebra captures the minimal structure needed to derive measure theory.
From just four axioms (order, associativity, identity, Archimedean), we can prove:
1. The combination operation must be isomorphic to addition
2. There exists a unique (up to scale) representation as (ℝ≥0, +)

This is the **REPRESENTATION THEOREM** - the crown jewel of the K&S approach!
-/

/-- A Knuth-Skilling Algebra: the minimal axiomatic structure for deriving probability.

**Axioms** (following Knuth & Skilling, Appendix A of "Foundations of Inference"):
1. **Order**: The operation is strictly monotone (more plausibility → larger result)
2. **Associativity**: (x ⊕ y) ⊕ z = x ⊕ (y ⊕ z)
3. **Identity**: x ⊕ 0 = x (combining with impossibility changes nothing)
4. **Archimedean**: No infinitesimals (for any positive x, y, some n·x > y)

**Consequences** (THEOREMS, not axioms!):
- The operation is isomorphic to addition on ℝ≥0
- There exists a linearizing map Θ : α → ℝ with Θ(x ⊕ y) = Θ(x) + Θ(y)
- This Θ is unique up to positive scaling

This structure is MORE GENERAL than probability spaces - it applies to any
"combining" operation satisfying these symmetries (semigroups, monoids, etc.)

**IMPORTANT**: We extend LinearOrder (not PartialOrder) because the K&S paper
implicitly assumes trichotomy ("three possibilities are exhaustive" - line 1339).
See the Counterexample section below for a formal proof that PartialOrder is insufficient. -/
class KnuthSkillingAlgebra (α : Type*) extends LinearOrder α where
  /-- The combination operation (written ⊕ in papers, here `op`) -/
  op : α → α → α
  /-- Identity element (the "zero" or impossibility) -/
  ident : α
  /-- Associativity: (x ⊕ y) ⊕ z = x ⊕ (y ⊕ z) -/
  op_assoc : ∀ x y z : α, op (op x y) z = op x (op y z)
  /-- Right identity: x ⊕ 0 = x -/
  op_ident_right : ∀ x : α, op x ident = x
  /-- Left identity: 0 ⊕ x = x (derivable from commutativity, but convenient) -/
  op_ident_left : ∀ x : α, op ident x = x
  /-- Strict monotonicity in first argument -/
  op_strictMono_left : ∀ y : α, StrictMono (fun x => op x y)
  /-- Strict monotonicity in second argument -/
  op_strictMono_right : ∀ x : α, StrictMono (fun y => op x y)
  /-- Archimedean property: no infinitesimals.
      For any x > ident and any y, there exists n such that iterating x surpasses y.
      We formalize this by requiring that the iterate sequence is unbounded. -/
  op_archimedean : ∀ x y : α, ident < x → ∃ n : ℕ, y < Nat.iterate (op x) n x
  /-- Positivity: identity is the bottom element.
      This is K&S Axiom I - there is a bottom element ⊥ such that ∀x, x ≥ ⊥.
      In measure/probability theory, this means "plausibility cannot be negative".
      This axiom eliminates degenerate cases where x < ident. -/
  ident_le : ∀ x : α, ident ≤ x

/-! ## CRITICAL: Why LinearOrder is REQUIRED (not just PartialOrder)

The K&S paper (line 1339) says: "these three possibilities (<, >, =) are exhaustive"
This is the **trichotomy axiom** - it requires LINEAR order, not just partial order!

**COUNTEREXAMPLE**: ℝ² with coordinate-wise order satisfies all axioms EXCEPT totality,
but has incomparable elements, so the representation theorem FAILS.

We formalize this counterexample below to demonstrate the necessity of LinearOrder.
