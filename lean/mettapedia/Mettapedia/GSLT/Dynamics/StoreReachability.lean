# Store reachability, collection, and deployment-stable garbage

The GSLT form of garbage collection, sealed at its semantic core.

* A store is a pointer graph with roots; **reachability** is the least
  relation closed under roots and edges; **garbage is its complement** — a
  derived judgment, never separately authored.
* **Collection is invisible**: restricting a store to its reachable part
  preserves reachability exactly (`reach_collect`), hence preserves every
  observation that factors through the reachable part, and is idempotent.
* **The deployment theorem** (the Stay condition): garbage is stable under
  deployment contexts — contexts that run alongside a configuration, own
  their own cells, and reference the configuration only through a declared
  live interface.  An unforgeable unreachable cell stays unreachable under
  every such composition (`deployment_cannot_resurrect`).
* **The reification counterexample**: composing WITHOUT the deployment
  closure — a context that forges a reference into the representation —
  resurrects garbage (`forging_resurrects`).  Ambient reification of the
  containing store is exactly what the closure forbids; reified stores must
  be granted explicitly.
* **Complete roots are load-bearing**: scanning with a root class omitted
  makes a live cell unreachable (`omitted_root_loses_cell`) — the semantic
  form of the nested-frame witness.

The step/collect naturality law and the tracing/refcount duality live in the
executable reference model and the native differential gates; this module
seals the reachability core those gates rely on.

/-! ## The behavioral bridge

Stay's garbage is temporal — no future interaction — while `garbage` above is
structural.  The bridge: for any mutator that never resurrects (a step never
makes an unreachable cell reachable) and any interaction judgment that only
touches reachable cells, structural garbage implies behavioral garbage.
Completeness fails by design: a reachable cell that never interacts is
behavioral garbage but not structural garbage — reachability is the sound
decidable over-approximation, and that is a theorem, not an apology. -/

cell reachable.  This packages "reachable-only dereferencing + no forging". -/

/-! ## Moving collection: the evacuation certificate

The native collector MOVES live cells.  Its correctness statement is not
`reach_collect` but preservation up to renaming: an evacuation carries live
cells across an injective renaming, keeps exactly the live edges, and
preserves reachability as the image.  The from-space invariant — no edge of
the evacuated store touches an unmoved cell — holds by construction. -/
